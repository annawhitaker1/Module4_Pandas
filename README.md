Analysis Summary
    We were provided two related CSV files to start our analysis, schools_complete and students_compete. In the starter code, these two related CSVs were merged to one data frame for the class to analyze. The data set included records on 39170 different students including their Student ID, their name, gender, grade, the schoolâ€™s name they were enrolled in, reading score, math score, School ID, type of school, size of the school, and the budget. This data set provided some insightful conclusions. 

Two conclusions or comparisons from the calculations
    One conclusion to mention is the % of students that passed reading compared to math in the district summary. In the district summary statistics that we calculated, students were 14% more likely to pass reading than to pass math. 
    Another conclusion to mention is the top performing school as it relates to overall passing percentage of math and reading scores. Between all the schools included in the data set, Cabrera High held the highest overall passing rate at 91.33%. This is an impressive statistic as the combined pass rate across all the schools is only 65.17%
